Redesign for Nintendo Software Support Group website stuck in 1990s

[This article](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6351467/nintendos-ancient-developer-site) brought to my attention a tragedy of antiquated web design. I was compelled to fix it. I don't know what the backend looks like once you login, but I can at least present a better landing page.
